in Task 1 we were required to create a function that:
Takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled. 

in Task 2 we were required to add a function that takes two arrays as arguments: - 
An array of strings. - 
An array of numbers processed by processArray. 
â€¢ The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number: 
Capitalize the entire string if the number is even. - 
Task 3: 
Convert the string to lowercase if the number is odd. 

in Task 3
We created a function in a new file that:g
Takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. - 
Task 4: 
Returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, 
and id (auto-incremented starting from 1).
